Some popular questions you may have in your mind
======
1. Why is it a 4 credit course?

One straightforward answer is it comes under advanced machine learning courses. The skills
which you will gain from the courses are not ordinary. Most of the theoretical concepts
integrated with lab exercise gives you an unique experience which is difficult to see in other
courses.

2. Is it difficult to qualify in comparison to other 3-credit courses?

No. One biggest advantage the course brings to you is an opportunity to balance your
theoretical and coding strengths. Weightage divided between theory and coding is 50:50. Those
who have a strong interest in either of these can easily sail through it.

Note: Sometimes, 3-unit courses can be a lot harder than 4-unit courses. It usually just
means the course doesn’t have extensive practical sessions, but that just makes it even
harder without lowering the workload

3. Do we need some prior knowledge before joining the course?
   
Yes, but basic knowledge. The lessons from class 12 mathematics (e.g. solving linear
equations, differentiation, calculating probabilities etc) should be suffice to grasp the class
learnings.

4. Which programming language is used for coding and what level of
proficiency is expected?

Preferably Python. But there is a flexibility to choose any other programming language also. If
you possess the skill to play with arrays and matrices, and basic operations on them would be
good to start with. Working with some library packages e.g. networkx, scipy etc. can be learned
as the course progresses.
