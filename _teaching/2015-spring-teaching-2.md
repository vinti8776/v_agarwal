CS426@Pilani (First time introduced in Fall 2021)
======
Graph mining CSF426 was introduced for the first time at Pilani campus in the fall 2021
semester and has been taught twice till May 2023. It was liked by previous batches
primarily not because it has tremendous applications in the data science domain, but
due to the learning style with examples and coding exercise. The fun part of the course
is every two lectures followed by a small programming exercise, sometimes with
missing lines of code type fun quiz. Coding enthusiasts can take this opportunity to test
their skills and earn scores in the easiest way.

Unique features of the course
======
1. Open class discussion once in a month with faculty and peers.
2. Peers feedback on Quiz or assignment
3. Learning with examples and coding

Who should take this course?
======
Anyone who wishes to learn:
- state-of-the-art graph based machine learning algorithms and deep learning
algorithms.
- Python implementation of basic graph algorithms (e.g. pagerank, spectral clustering,
laplacian etc) from scratch
- Handling of unstructured datasets originated from multiple sources and their
transformation into graphs (Case studies include social and medical data)
- Working details of graph neural network architectures and its application in prediction and classification tasks



<!--Some popular questions you may have in your mind
======
- Why is it a 4 credit course?

One straightforward answer is it comes under advanced machine learning courses. The skills
which you will gain from the courses are not ordinary. Most of the theoretical concepts
integrated with lab exercise gives you an unique experience which is difficult to see in other
courses.

- Is it difficult to qualify in comparison to other 3-credit courses?

No. One biggest advantage the course brings to you is an opportunity to balance your
theoretical and coding strengths. Weightage divided between theory and coding is 50:50. Those
who have a strong interest in either of these can easily sail through it.

Note: Sometimes, 3-unit courses can be a lot harder than 4-unit courses. It usually just
means the course doesn’t have extensive practical sessions, but that just makes it even
harder without lowering the workload

- Do we need some prior knowledge before joining the course?
   
Yes, but basic knowledge. The lessons from class 12 mathematics (e.g. solving linear
equations, differentiation, calculating probabilities etc) should be suffice to grasp the class
learnings.

- Which programming language is used for coding and what level of
proficiency is expected?

Preferably Python. But there is a flexibility to choose any other programming language also. If
you possess the skill to play with arrays and matrices, and basic operations on them would be
good to start with. Working with some library packages e.g. networkx, scipy etc. can be learned
as the course progresses.-->
